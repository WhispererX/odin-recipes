        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake
            recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes
            with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your
            kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Flour: </b>This homemade pancake recipe starts with
                all-purpose flour.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Baking powder: </b>A leavener, is the secret to fluffy
                pancakes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Sugar: </b>Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll
                need for subtly sweet pancakes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Salt: </b>A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor
                without making your pancakes taste salty.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Milk</b> and <b>butter: </b>Milk and butter add moisture and
                richness to the pancakes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Egg: </b>A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps
                bind the pancake batter together.
            </li>
        </ul>
