        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a
            crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It
            reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will prepare 8 servings, the cook time will be around 90 minutes
            and it will take 15 minutes of preparation.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
            <li>1/2 medium onion, diced</li>
            <li>1/2 large bell pepper, diced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
            <li>3 ounces tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>
                2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried
                oregano
            </li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley, packed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>Salt</li>

            <li>1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced</li>
            <li>1/4 pound freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Put pasta water on to boil:</h4>
                <p>
                    Put a large pot of salted water (1 tablespoon of salt for
                    every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. It
                    can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil
                    (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in the
                    next steps while the water is heating.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Brown the ground beef:</h4>
                <p>
                    In a large skillet, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on
                    medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it is
                    lightly browned on all sides.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remove the beef with slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all
                    but a tablespoon of fat.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>
                    Cook the bell pepper, onions, and garlic; add back the beef:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Add the diced bell pepper and onions to the skillet (in the
                    photo, we are using yellow bell pepper and red onions).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent
                    and the peppers softened. Add the minced garlic and cook
                    half a minute more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir to combine,
                    reduce the heat to low, and cook for another 5 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Make the sauce:</h4>
                <p>
                    Transfer the beef mixture to a medium-sized (3- to 4-quart)
                    pot. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato
                    paste to the pot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Add the parsley, oregano, and Italian seasonings, adjusting
                    the amounts to taste. Sprinkle with garlic powder and/or
                    garlic salt, to taste.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sprinkle with red or white wine vinegar. Stir in sugar, a
                    tablespoon at a time, tasting after each addition. (The
                    amount of sugar needed will vary, depending on how acidic
                    your tomatoes are.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Add salt to taste. Remember that you will later be adding
                    parmesan, which is salty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to
                    maintain a low simmer. Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring
                    often. Scrape the bottom of the pot occasionally, making
                    sure nothing sticks to the bottom and scorches.
                </p>
                <p>Remove from heat.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles:</h4>
                <p>
                    By now, the salted water you started heating in step one
                    should be boiling. Add the dry lasagna noodles and cook them
                    to al dente, per package directions. (Note: noodles may be
                    cooked in advance.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stir the water often to prevent sticking. Make sure that the
                    water remains at a full rolling boil during the entire
                    cooking process, in order to prevent noodles from sticking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the noodles are done, drain them in a colander and
                    rinse with cool water, gently separating any noodles that
                    may be sticking together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Spread a little olive oil on a large, rimmed baking sheet,
                    and lay out the cooked noodles on this sheet, turning them
                    once so that all sides get coated with some of the olive
                    oil. This will prevent them from sticking together.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li><h4>Preheat the over to 375&deg;F</h4></li>
            <li>
                <h4>Assemble the lasagna:</h4>
                <p>
                    In a 9x13-inch casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a cup of
                    sauce over the bottom of the dish and spread it evenly.
                    Arrange one layer of lasagna noodles lengthwise over the
                    sauce (about 3 long noodles; the edges may overlap,
                    depending on your pan). Ladle a third of the remaining sauce
                    over the noodles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sprinkle a third of the grated mozzarella on top of the
                    lasagna sauce. Add half of the ricotta cheese by placing
                    cheese dollops every two inches. Sprinkle half of the grated
                    parmesan cheese evenly over the top of the ricotta cheese.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apply the second layer of noodles. Top it with half of the
                    remaining sauce. Add half of the remaining mozzarella, the
                    rest of the ricotta cheese, and the rest of the parmesan
                    cheese.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finish with a final layer of noodles. Spread the remaining
                    sauce over the top layer of noodles and sprinkle with the
                    remaining mozzarella cheese.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Bake:</h4>
                <p>
                    Cover the lasagna pan with aluminum foil, tenting the foil
                    slightly so it doesn't touch the noodles or sauce. Bake at
                    375Â°F for 45 minutes. If you'd like more of a crusty top or
                    edges, uncover the lasagna in the last 10 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Cool and serve:</h4>
                <p>
                    Allow the lasagna to cool for at least 15 minutes before
                    serving. Leftovers will keep for about 5 days. You can
                    reheat lasagna in a conventional oven or microwave. While
                    storing, leave the aluminum tent on. (Try to keep the
                    aluminum foil from touching the sauce.)
                </p>
